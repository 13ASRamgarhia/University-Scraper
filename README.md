This is the very first version of Web Scraper which was developed during my internship at Connexio Inc. The project was developed for extracting the required data for the app. Later, it was submitted as Project-I in the sixth semester of my bachelor's.

NOTE: This web scraper was developed as a sample of what was used during the internship. This was developed for the academic project only. The final version of the project cannot be posted public. This version can extract Application Link, University type, Link for university funding, University setting, and Established year.
